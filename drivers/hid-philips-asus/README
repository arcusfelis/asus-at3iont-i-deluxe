hid-philips-asus
================

This is the driver for the "PHILIPS MCE USB IR Receiver- Spinel plusf0r ASUS"
remote device with id 0471:206C.

Configure
===================
Edit mappings.h to assign your custom button mappings.

Compile and install
===================

To compile and install do:

make
sudo make install

This will compile and install the hid-philips-asus driver under your kernels
directory:

/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/

Loading hid-philips-asus
=============
Run:
sudo modprobe hid-philips-asus

or add hid-philips-asus to etc/modules and reboot

IMPORTANT:
The module depends on usbhid but it has to be loaded *before* the usbhid module,
in order to claim the device. Otherwise usbhid claims the device and
hid-philips-asus can not act on it.

The problem is that other loaded hid modules might depend on usbhid,
so you cannot just unload it.
As a workaround there is the script 'load-module.sh' which unloads all loaded
hid modules, loads hid-philips-asus and then reloads the rest of previously
loaded hid modules.
The script has to be run as root:
sudo sh /usr/src/asus-at3iont-i-deluxe-1.0.1/drivers/hid-philips-asus/load-module.sh

I suggest executing this script from /etc/rc.local.
You can add there the line above before the exit command.

If you use lirc then you might want to restart it after executing this script.

Supported kernels
=================

This driver has been tested to compile in 2.6.32
