ASUS_AT3IONT_I_DELUXE kernel modules source
===========================================

This package can be used to build the kernel modules for the remote and the
bluetooth devices on ASUS AT3IONT-I DELUXE motherboard.
Available drivers are:
Remote driver:		hid-philips-asus
Bluetooth driver:	ath3k

The bluetooth driver will be included in standard kernel release in the future,
so then you can remove it from the build list.

The package uses dkms and standard dkms mechanisms to do the automatic building.

=============
1. Edit modules.conf to select which drivers to build.

2. Edit mappings.h in hid-philips-asus dir to configure the remote keymap.
